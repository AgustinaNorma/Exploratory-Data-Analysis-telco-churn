I'm Trying to do Exploratory Data Analysis in Customer who will churn in telco_churn dataset
The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Conclusion:
Customers whose payment methods use electronic checks and month-to-month contracts are more likely to decide to churn compared to other payment methods which are still quite high, possibly with payment methods that are not automatic every month, making customers feel less effective, because they have to check and pay Every month.

Suggestion: conduct a survey for payment methods and contracts for using the service, so that the churn rate can decrease.
